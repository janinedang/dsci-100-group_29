# DSCI 100 Project: Creating a Classification Model for Dry Beans
In this project for the DSCI 100 course at UBC, we explore the following question(s): Can we classify the type of dry bean based on its features, and if so, is it possible to create a classification with high accuracy based on a dataset of dry bean features? Which features will be best in determining bean type?
